This file is self-contained: every section it needs is below. Read nothing
else. The **Reattach** section applies only if `$ROOM` or `$NICKNAME` is
missing; follow the **Receive loop** contract before replying while in a
room, put every question to the user per the **Decisions** section, and drive
task events per the **Event handling** section.
